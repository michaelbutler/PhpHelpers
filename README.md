# PhpHelpers
Generic helpers that pretty much everyone always has their own version(s) of. These are mine.


# Installation

Add this to composer.json:

```text
"repositories": [
    {
        "url": "https://github.com/michaelbutler/PhpHelpers.git",
        "type": "vcs"
    }
]
```

Then in the project you'd like to add this to, run:

```text
composer require "butler/php-helpers:dev-main"
```

To update in the future, run:

```text
composer update "butler/php-helpers"
```
